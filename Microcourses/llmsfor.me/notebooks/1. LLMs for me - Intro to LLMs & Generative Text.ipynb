        "\n",
        "What is a large language language model (LLM)? While there is no universally accepted definition for an LLM, large language models are a type of deep learning model that is understood be both very large in size (number of parameters) and also trained on very large datasets. Lately, the datasets used to train LLMs have grown increasingly in size and it is not unusual for these to represent double digit percentages of the web.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are a type of *deep learning* model, also known as a neural network, a type of machine learning model that seeks to imitate the structure of the human brain. Traditional deep learning models take inputs - structured data found in rows and columns like in a database, or unstructured data like images, video, audio, or, in the case of natural language processing (NLP) models, free-form text - and use these to make predictions about a target variables associated with each observation (row) in the input data. For example, in the case of a deep learning models for computer vision, the input could be a dataset of images and the output to predict an associated data label (which Japanese character is this?).\n",

        "Deep learning models are composed of *layers*, each of which is composed of *nodes*, and each of the nodes has inputs which come from previous layers and associated *weights* which are multiplied by each of the inputs. Collectively, these weights are referred to as the model *parameters* we mentioned earlier, and what is learned in the \"learning\" of deep learning is the optimal values for these numeric parameters to best predict the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large language models are a category of deep learning models with the following properties:\n",
        "- They primarily work with language data (*i.e.* text), either as input, or output, or both - either solely or in conjuction with other data types (images, audio, video, etc.), in which case the LLMs are referred to as *multimodal*.\n",
        "- As mentioned above, LLMs are understood to be both very large in size in both model size (hundreds of millions, billions, hundreds of billions, or even *trillions* of parameters) as well as trained on very large datasets, comprising hundreds of millions or billions of tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is from the latter of these two properties that the remarkable capabilities of recent LLMs has arisen. There is one another important fundamental development which lead to the rise of LLMs as we know them today and that is the transformer architecture."

        "We refer to the structure of a deep learning network as its *architecture* - the example showed in the previous section is that of the simplest type of deep learning model architecture referred to as a *feed-forward* or *fully connected* neural network, since the outputs of each node in the hidden layers serve as input for each node in the following layer.\n",

        "There are many different types of more complex and specialized architectures for specific tasks and use cases in deep learning. This have arisen from years of research in academia and application in industry. For example, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are the standard for working with computer vision tasks and have different types of layers specifically suited for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer architecture is an enitrely new type of neural network architecture of which the vast majority (but not all) large language models are. The Transformer was introduced fairly recently in the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al, 2018) by researchers from Google Brain. As an interesting side note, contributors to the paper have moved on to notable AI startups - Aiden Gomez went on to be one of the founders of the OpenAI competitior [Cohere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohere) and Noam Shazeer to co-found [Character.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character.ai). While the transformer architecture was originally devised to be applied to a text-to-text translation task (English and German) and work with what now comparatively is a very small dataset, it has now been found to be broadly applicable and highly performant to a very wide variety of natural language processing tasks and represents the state-of-the-art for most of these, ranging from text generation which will cover in this workshop, to other applications such as image generation, such as with OpenAI's [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E) models.\n",

        "\n",
        "The transformer model is made up of two large blocks: the *encoder* block on the left, and the *decoder* block on the right. While the original transformer architecture was comprised of both of these, there are now specific models which are composed of stacked blocks of each type. For example, models in the research can be *encoder-only* or *decoder-only* models, or a fully transformer with both encoder and decoder. It should be noted that, in practice, these would all still be referred to as transformer models even though the former two are not \"full\" transformers based upon the strict definition of the architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoder and decoder models have different tasks to which they are well-suited. Generally speaking, encoder models take text as input and produce a higher dimensional representation of the dataset (corpus) of text - an *embedding* - on which they are trained. You will also sometime hear encoder models referred to *autoencoding* models, as they perform a similar task to the traditional [autoencoder model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) in deep learning.\n",

        "Decoder models, on the other hand, take inputs and produces output probabilities. Most commonly, these are known for doing text generation, where the model take a sequence of text as input and makes predictions about the most likely occuring words which come next, as made famous by the [Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) model by OpenAI which we will work with shortly. You will also hear decoder-only models referred to as *autoregressive* models, as they take their own outputs as inputs (in order to make predictions about a sequence of text, word-by-word) and uses these to predict probabilities for the next word (a regression task). As we will see shortly, this type of task in natural language processing is also referred to as *causal language modeling*."
